1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. Error! `result` exists only in the if-statement's block. No access to it outside the block since it's declared using `let`. 
5. Error! You cannot change the value of `result` since it's declared using `const`.
6. The code exits with error in Question5, so line13 is not executed (if executed, `result` is undefined in the outer scope, so another error)
